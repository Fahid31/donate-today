            <p id="donate-plan-para">Donars often ask us to know about our strategy of donation.
                We usually work on three<br> different sections so that every amount put an impact on each person's life.</p>

                <h2>Food for family</h2>
                <p>There are so many families that undergo some unbearable circumstances such as lack of foods. We will provide them foods for one-month from your donation. In every week, we provides food for 1000+ families to different places</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Shelter for a family</h2>
                    <p>More than 9 million are homeless. They don't have a place to live. We already made shelter houseS for affected people. Also we are working to build 100+ houses for homeless. The medical boat will travel to shelters and marooned families to treat sick patients who currently do not have access to medical care </p>

                    <h2>  Education for a child</h2>
                    <p>The fact that a child is orphaned does not mean that there is an invaluable experience that can be learned and shared with others. Orphaned childrens don't get much opportunity to study. But we don't want to let them fall. To develop their educational career. Our foundation works on with the help of your donation.</p>
